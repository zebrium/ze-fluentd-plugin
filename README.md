# LINUX COLLECTOR DETAILS
Zebrium's fluentd output plugin sends the logs you collect with Fluentd on Linux to Zebrium for automated Anomaly detection.
Our github repository is located [here](https://github.com/zebrium/ze-fluentd-plugin).

For instructions on deploying our fluentd collector for Docker environmens, please see Docker setup [here](https://docs.zebrium.com/docs/setup/docker)

# ze-fluentd-plugin

## System Requirements
The following OS distributions are supported:
1. Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04
2. CentOS/RHEL 7/8
3. Amazon Linux 2

## Getting Started

### Installing

0. If the environment uses a proxy server please the section "Operation with a Proxy Server" below.
1. Get Zebrium API server URL and authentication token from [Zebrium](https://www.zebrium.com).
2. Determine what deployment name to use.
3. Run the following command in a shell on host:
   ```
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zebrium/ze-fluentd-plugin/master/install_collector.sh | ZE_LOG_COLLECTOR_URL=<ZAPI_URL> ZE_LOG_COLLECTOR_TOKEN=<AUTH_TOKEN> ZE_HOST_TAGS="ze_deployment_name=<deployment_name>" /bin/bash
   ```
   The default system log file paths are defined by the ZE_LOG_PATHS environment variable. Its default value is
   ```
   "/var/log/*.log,/var/log/syslog,/var/log/messages,/var/log/secure"
   ```
   The ZE_USER_LOG_PATHS environment variable can be used to add more user specific log file paths. For example, to add app log files at `/app1/log/app1.log` and `/app2/log/\*.log`, you can set ZE_USER_LOG_PATHS to:
   ```
   "/app1/log/app1.log,/app2/log/*.log"
   ```

## Upgrading
The upgrade command is similar to the installation command:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zebrium/ze-fluentd-plugin/master/install_collector.sh | ZE_LOG_COLLECTOR_URL=<ZAPI_URL> ZE_LOG_COLLECTOR_TOKEN=<AUTH_TOKEN> ZE_HOST_TAGS="ze_deployment_name=<deployment_name>" OVERWRITE_CONFIG=1 /bin/bash
```
Please note setting `OVERWRITE_CONFIG` to 1 will cause `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` to be upgraded to latest version.

## Uninstalling

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zebrium/ze-fluentd-plugin/master/install_collector.sh | ZE_OP=uninstall /bin/bash
```

## Installing on Hosts with Existing td-agent Configuration

It is possible to add Zebrium output plugin on a host with existing td-agent configuration without running Zebrium log collector installer.  Zebrium output plugin is provided through RubyGems [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/fluent-plugin-zebrium_output)
1. Run the following command:
   ```
   sudo td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-zebrium_output
   ```
3. Add Zebrium output configuration to `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`. Below is an example configuration which duplicates log messages and sends one copy to Zebrium.
   ```
   <match **>
     @type copy
     # Zebrium log collector
     <store>
       @type zebrium
       ze_log_collector_url "ZE_LOG_COLLECTOR_URL"
       ze_log_collector_token "ZE_LOG_COLLECTOR_TOKEN"
       ze_host_tags "ze_deployment_name=#{Socket.gethostname},myapp=test2"
       @log_level "info"
       <buffer tag>
         @type file
         path "/var/td-agent/zebrium"
         flush_mode "interval"
         flush_interval "60s"
       </buffer>
     </store>
     <store>
         @type OTHER_OUTPUT_PLUGIN
         ...
     </store>
   </match>
   ```

## Configuration
The configuration file for td-agent is at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.
The following parameters must be configured for your instance:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Note</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ze_log_collector_url</td>
    <td>Zebrium log host URL</td>
    <td>Provided by Zebrium once your account has been created.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ze_log_collector_token</td>
    <td>Authentication token</td>
    <td>Provided by Zebrium once your account has been created.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>path</td>
    <td>Log files to read</td>
    <td>Both files and file patterns are allowed. Files should be separated by comma. The default value is `"/var/log/*.log,/var/log/syslog,/var/log/messages,/var/log/secure"`</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ze_host_tags</td>
    <td>Host meta data</td>
    <td>This parameter is optional. You can pass meta data in key-value pairs, the format is: "key1=value1,key2=value2". We suggest at least set one tag for deployment name: "ze_deployment_name=&lt;your_deployment_name&gt;"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ze_host_in_logpath</td>
    <td>Log path component for remote host name </td>
    <td>This parameter is optional. For situations where a remote host name is embedded in the log file directory path structure, e.g. "/var/log/remote/&lt;host&gt;/...", this can be used as the originating host for the log by setting this parameter to the path component to be used for the hostname. The value should be an integer, 1-based. In this example the configuration would be "ze_host_in_logpath=4".</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ze_forward_tag</td>
    <td>Tag to specify log-forwarded sources</td>
    <td>This parameter is optional. It can be used to indicate sources that are being used for remote log forwarding, by specifying a specific fluentd "tag" to one or more sources.  The default tag value is "ze_forwarded_logs".</td> 
  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ze_path_map_file</td>
      <td>Path mapping file</td>
      <td>This parameter is optional. It allows embedded semantic data (ids, tags,configs) in logfile paths to be parsed and added to Zebrium log data. Set to the full path of a JSON file containing mapping information. Default is empty string. See below under Log Path Mapping</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### User Log Paths
User log paths can be configured via `/etc/td-agent/log-file-map.conf`. During log collector service startup, if `/etc/td-agent/log-file-map.conf` exists, log collector service script writes log paths defined in `/etc/td-agent/log-file-map.conf` to `/etc/td-agent/conf.d/user.conf`. Please note any user log paths configured at installation time via ZE_USER_LOG_PATHS must be added to `/etc/td-agent/log-file-map.conf` to avoid being overwritten.
```
{
  "mappings": [
    {
      "file": "/app1/log/error.log",
      "alias": "app1_error"
    },
    {
      "file": "/app2/log/error.log",
      "alias": "app2_error"
    },
    {
      "file": "/var/log/*.log",
      "exclude": "/var/log/my_debug.log,/var/log/my_test.log"
    }
  ]
}
```
### Filtering Specific Log Events
If you wish to exclude certain sensitive or noisy events from being sent to Zebrium, you can filter them at the source collection point by doing the following:

1. Add the following in /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf after other "@include":
   ```
   @include conf.d/log_msg_filters.conf
   ```
2. Create a config file /etc/td-agent/conf.d/log_msg_filters.conf containing:
   ```
   <filter TAG_FOR_LOG_FILE>
     @type grep
     <exclude>
       key message
       pattern /<PATTERN_FOR_LOG_MESSAGES>/
   </exclude>
   </filter>
   ```
3. Restart td-agent: sudo systemctl restart td-agent

**Example**

Below is an example `log_msg_filters.conf` for filtering out specific messages from a Vertica log file at `/fast1/vertica_catalog/zdb/v_zdb_node0001_catalog/vertica.log`

In this example, the Fluentd tag for file is node.logs.<FILE_NAME_REPLACE_/_WITH_DOT> (i.e replace all slashes with dots in the file path).

```
<filter node.logs.fast1.vertica_catalog.zdb.v_zdb_node0001_catalog.vertica.log>
  @type grep
  <exclude>
    key message
    pattern /^[^2]|^.[^0]|TM Merge|Authenticat|[Ll]oad *[Bb]alanc[ei]|\[Session\] <INFO>|\[Catalog\] <INFO>|\[Txn\] <INFO>|Init Session.*<LOG>/
  </exclude>
</filter>
```
### Log Path Mapping
Log path mapping allows semantic information (ids, configs and tags) to be extracted from log paths
and passed to the Zebrium backend. For example, log-file specific host information or business-related
tags that are embedded in the path of the log file can be extracted..

Log path mapping is configured using a JSON file, with format:
```
{
  "mappings": {
    "patterns": [
      "regex1", ...
    ],
    "tags": [
      "tag_name", ...
    ],
    "ids": [
      "id_name",...
    ],
    "configs": [
       "config_name",...
    ]
  }
}
```
Set "patterns" to regular expressions to match the log file path. Each regex named capture in a matching regular expression will be compared to the "tags", "ids" and "configs" sections and added to the corresponding record section(s).
Use the ze_path_map_file configuration parameter to specify the path to the JSON file.
### Environment Variables
If the environment is using a proxy server to access the Internet then standard variables (e.g. http\_proxy) should be configured prior to installation. Please see below at "Operation with a Proxy Server".
## Usage
### Start/stop Fluentd
Fluentd agent can be started or stopped with the command:
```
sudo systemctl <start | stop> td-agent
```
## Testing your installation
Once the collector has been deployed in your environment, your logs and anomaly detection will be available in the Zebrium UI.
## Troubleshooting
In the event that Zebrium requires the collector logs for troubleshooting, logs are located here:

1. Collector installation log:  `/tmp/zlog-collector-install.log.*`

2. Collector runtime log: `/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`

In case of an HTTP connection error, please check the spelling of the Zebrium host URL. Also check that any network proxy servers are configured appropriately.

Please contact Zebrium at <support@zebrium.com> if you need any assistance.
## Operation with a Proxy Server
If the agent environment requires a non-transparent proxy server to be configured this should be done at two points:

* The standard http\_proxy and https\_proxy environment variables must be set in the local environment when the installer is run. This allows the installer to access the Internet to download necessary components.

* After installation is run the system service also needs to have the same environment variables available. This allows the Zebrium agent to communicate with the log host to send logs.

### Setting proxy server in a systemd environment
If the agent service is run from systemd and a proxy server is in use, the service needs to have the appropriate proxy configuration added to systemd. (This may not be needed if your system is already configured so that all systemd services globally use a proxy.) To do this, after the installation is performed edit the file /etc/systemd/service/td-agent.service.d/override.conf to add environment configuration lines for the proxy server, for example:

```
Environment=http_proxy=myproxy.example.com:8080
```
After this is done the systemd daemon should be reloaded, and then the service started:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl restart td-agent
```
